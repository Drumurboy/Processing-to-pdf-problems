# Processing-to-pdf-problems
I'm fairly new to processing but I have a working sketch that I have been using as my logo for a while. I need a vector version so I can easily scale it. I have the pdf export working to the point where it outputs a pdf but the file is completely blank and I don't know what to do. Thought I would put it up so someone who knows processing could see what I'm doing wrong and give some advice!


import processing.pdf.*;

boolean record;

float r = 0;
int csize = 2;
int grow = 0;
int n = 0;

void setup(){
 size (1920, 1080);
 
 smooth ();
 background(10);
   

}

void draw (){
    if (record) {
    beginRecord(PDF, "frame-####.pdf"); 
  }  
  
 translate (width/2, height/2);
 

 fill(255);
 rotate (r);
 
 r = r + .1;
   if (n % 89 == 0) {
    grow = 12;
  }
  if (csize > 33) {
    csize = 33;
    grow = -6;
  }
  if (csize < 0) {
    csize = 0;
    grow = 0;
  }
  
   // where the spiral starts + r / spacing 
  ellipse (50 + r / 3.6, 50 + r / 3.6, csize / 1.2, csize / 1.2);
  csize = csize + grow;
  n = n + 1;
  
    if (record) {
    endRecord();
    record = false;
  }
}

// Hit 'r' to record a single frame
void keyPressed() {
  if (key == 's') {
    record = true;
  }
}
